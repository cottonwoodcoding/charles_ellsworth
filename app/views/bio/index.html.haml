      = "Born and raised in the White Mountains of Arizona, Charles Ellsworth first gained an appreciation for a simple, not so distant past.  His vivid lyrics and near-familiar melodies weave to tell stories of heartbreak and loneliness while shining a light on the perseverance of the human spirit.  Charles has subtle way of exploring the idea that even when all seems lost, there is always a sliver of hope. Declan Ryan of #{link_to('Independent Clauses', 'http://www.independentclauses.com', {target: '_blank'})} called his and Vincent Draper's recent release Salt Lake City: A Love Story, 'a triumph for american songwritingâ€¦blending outlaw grit with a raw streak of self-awareness.' His ability to go from a stomp-your-boots anthem reminiscent of Springsteen, to a simple love song in the vein of Townes Van Zandt assures that it won't be long before his name, lyrics, and melodies are stuck in music lovers head's everywhere.".html_safe
