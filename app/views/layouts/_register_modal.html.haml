        %p I hope you have all had a great New Year so far and enjoyed your break from me bothering you for the 12 Days of Wildcat :).  I'm going to be reaching out to all of the drawing winners this week to get everything sorted and mail out your gifts as soon as possible, so keep a heads up for that.

        %p As i've said before, i'm so excited about the future and what this year has to bring for me.  I'm working on getting all the writing and planning done for the next record that I'll be recording with producer Bob Hoag at Flying Blanket Recording in Mesa, AZ.  This record and this year are all about trying to take risks and better define myself as an artist.  It's very exciting.

        %p I am planning a tour to make my way out West and am having some trouble booking shows at the moment.  If you all have any leads on bands or venues I should contact, or if you live in one of the following and feel like hosting a house show, that would be amazing. Please feel free to reach out to me by replying to this email and letting me know!
